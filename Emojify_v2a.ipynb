    "- If you have an NLP task where the training set is small, using word embeddings can help your algorithm significantly. \n",

    "- Training sequence models in Keras (and in most other deep learning frameworks) requires a few important details:\n",
    "    - To use mini-batches, the sequences need to be **padded** so that all the examples in a mini-batch have the **same length**. \n",
    "    - An `Embedding()` layer can be initialized with pretrained values. \n",
    "        - These values can be either fixed or trained further on your dataset. \n",
